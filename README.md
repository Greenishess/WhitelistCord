# WhitelistCord
A spigot plugin to have anyone whitelist themselves from a Discord bot. 

# How to use
Create a Discord bot. If you're already using DiscordSrv, you can use the same bot. Once you got your bot token, go to `/plugins/WhitelistCord/config.yml` and change botToken to your bot token then restart (or reload) your server. Then, in Discord, people will be able to use /whitelist <username> to whitelist themselves.
